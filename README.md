# TurtleBot3 Localization

This project focuses on localization for the TurtleBot3 robot using ROS (Robot Operating System). It provides the necessary packages and configuration for accurate robot localization in a simulated environment.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- ROS (Robot Operating System) of the desired distribution (e.g., Melodic, Noetic, etc.)
- TurtleBot3 ROS messages: `sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-turtlebot3-msgs`
- Gazebo for ROS simulation: `sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-gazebo*`
- TurtleBot3 ROS package: `sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-turtlebot3`
- TurtleBot3 teleoperation: `sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-turtlebot3-teleop`
- TF transformations library: `sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-tf*`
- Python 3 transforms3d library: `sudo pip3 install transforms3d`
- ROS plotJuggler for data visualization: `sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-plotjuggler*`

Make sure to replace `<distro>` with your specific ROS distribution (e.g., Melodic, Noetic, etc.).

## Environment Configuration

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Create a directory for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir turtlebot3_localization
   cd turtlebot3_localization
